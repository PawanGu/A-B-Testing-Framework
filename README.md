# A/B Testing Framework — Pricing & Promotion Impact on Conversion

This is a minimal, end-to-end A/B testing example using **synthetic e-commerce data**. It simulates a pricing+promotion experiment and runs a standard two-sample proportion z-test with confidence intervals, a sample size helper, and a simple figure.

## Contents
- `data/synthetic_ab_data.csv` — simulated users with assignment to control/treatment, price, promo flag, country, device, and conversion outcome
- `ab_test_analysis.py` — runnable analysis script
- `figures/group_conversion.png` — bar chart of conversion by group
- `report.md` — autogenerated summary with metrics and interpretation

## Quickstart
```bash
python ab_test_analysis.py
```

## What it demonstrates
- Randomized assignment and synthetic data generation
- Conversion rate calculation and **absolute/relative lift**
- **Two-sample z-test** for proportions with 95% CIs (Wilson)
- Power/MDE **sample size** calculation
- Simple matplotlib visualization

## Extend it
- Add CUPED / stratification by `country` or `device`
- Add multiple KPIs (CTR, AOV, revenue)
- Log results to a dashboard (Looker/Tableau/Power BI) or a simple Streamlit app

## Suggested CV Bullet
- **Designed an A/B testing framework in Python to evaluate pricing/promotions on conversion; implemented z-tests with CIs, lift metrics, and sample-size calculators; communicated insights via auto-generated reports and visuals.**
